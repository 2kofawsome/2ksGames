# 2ksGames
A collect of 2D turn based games that I have been creating from scratch with only the occasional search on stackoverflow.com, 
I have been trying to learn programming and not just learn how to look up what others have done in the past. 
I used Python 3 for this code with the GUI from tkinter.

Open "Games2k.py" to play, or open the "CreateSudokuBoards.py" to add new boards.
I would love for someone to add some more sudoku boards, just pull, fork and merge or however this works.
The new boards must be fully complete, not be repeats and have no errors to work.
Do not edit "SudokuBoards.txt" unless you want everything to break.

Please feel free to comment anything or whatever you do on GitHub, 
new to what to do at all so please lead me in the right direction with anything related to programming or GitHub.
