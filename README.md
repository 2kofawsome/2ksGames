# 2ksGames
A collect of 2D turn based games that I have been creating from scratch with only the occasional search on stackoverflow.com, I have been trying to learn programming and not just learn how to look up what others have done in the past. I used Python 3 for this code with the GUI from tkinter.

The .exe files should be able to be played by anyone, tell me if it does not work!

Please feel free to comment anything or whatever you do on GitHub, new to what to do at all so pleas elead me in the right direction with naything related to programming or GitHub. Each of the games are all together on the main "2ksGames" file, but it also includes unfinished games.
