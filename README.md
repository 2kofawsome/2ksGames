# 2ksGames
A collection of 2D turn based games that I have been creating from scratch, 
I have been trying to learn programming and not just learn how to look up what others have done in the past. 
I used Python 3 for this code with the GUI from tkinter as well as a few google APIs.

Games created are TicTacToe, Connect 4, Sudoku, 2048, MineSweeper, Checkers, BlackJack (21) and Hangman.

Open "Games2k.exe" to play, or take a look at the code itself with "Games2k.py" or any of the "gameFiles".
No need to enter gameFiles, but do so if you desire. I beleive the exe will only run on windows, not Apple, sorry.

If you see anything weird, cant get the game to run, etc please tell me. Email is samgunter12@gmail.com
