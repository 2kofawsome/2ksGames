# 2ksGames
A collect of 2D turn based games that I have been creating from scratch, 
I have been trying to learn programming and not just learn how to look up what others have done in the past. 
I used Python 3 for this code with the GUI from tkinter.

Open "Games2k.exe" to play, or open the "CreateSudokuBoards.exe" to add new boards.
I would love for someone to add some more sudoku boards, just pull, fork and merge or however this works.
TThe boards will not be excepted by the program unless they are fully complete, are not repeats and have no errors.
No need to enter gameFiles, but do it if you want.

Please feel free to comment anything or whatever you do on GitHub, 
new to what to do at all so please lead me in the right direction with anything related to programming or GitHub.
